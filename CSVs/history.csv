history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday march 17 2021

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

However I can never really read a historical book or text because they are often written in an extremely boring way to me and due to my adhd I get very easily distracted and lose focus or concentration. That is why I often give up after reading a few pages. However, I would really like to inform myself more about history as I really enjoy learning about it. I have just not found any sources that are more engaging and informative at the same time. It's extremely frustrating to me and always makes me feel bad if I can't make it through an entire source.

history,"I'm no history expert, but I do enjoy discussing basic ideas and facts with my kids. When we got to ""Who was the first European to set foot on what is now the U.S.,"" I had to pause. Of course I recalled that Columbus never made it to the mainland and instead explored several Caribbean islands. And I knew that Leif Erikson made it to what is now Canada. But I couldn't remember ever being taught the U.S. answer, which seemed odd to me as most school-taught history seems rather U.S.-proud.

I was surprised when Googling didn't result in one of those bold and neatly boxed answers at the top of the page. Even the first page of links didn't seem to disclose the answer in the page previews. After digging into a few articles, it seems the answer is pretty clear though: Juan Ponce de León, or at least one of his men. 

My question is, why was this relatively hard to uncover? Is it really not taught in U.S. schools? After reading, my first guesses at the answers would be: The Spanish are thought to have mainly explored the U.S. for plunder, intending only to return to their home country with riches and never settle the new land, in contrast to the English. I also wondered if racism might play a part: Columbus was sailing for Spain, but he was a white Italian, whereas Ponce de León was a Spaniard.

Please feel free to correct any errors I have made, and if you have any ideas about whether I'm right or wrong, or just bad at surface Internet research, feel free to share. Thanks.",seems relatively difficult to find out who the first european was to set foot on what is now the united states

history,"It's an idea for history buffs &amp; learners. I would love to see one of it exists already in some form.

An app/website with a virtual 3D globe and a time (year/era) selector.

It will be set to today and will list out all countries &amp; their respective rulers/government system.

In the time selector, the user can go back to earliest history of the Earth. The map will change accordingly to show Pangaea &amp; subsequent changes in geography. Simultaneously, it'll highlight notable occurrences such as dinosaurs, Ice Age, major floods, civilizations, empires, creation of major landmarks, wars, calamities, mines, religion, scientific developments - all major history of all regions known to mankind so far.

I want to be able to know what was happening in the Great Britain, Europe, China, the Americas, Australia at the time Mughals were ruling India.

history," 

The general gist I hear about WW1 was that it was a complete culture shock to all the countries fighting in it regarding how it was going to be fought, as though armies and soldiers were still expecting to march in lines on pitch battlefields. This lack of experience in the new era of modern war therefore leading to massive casualty numbers.

In complete hindsight, are there any wars or battles before WW1 with enough hints and signs where one could deduce that battles were about to significantly change and traditional standards of battle were becoming more archaic if not outright suicidal?

Like someone trying to warn generals before the war that these new machine guns were actually extremely deadly and we should start building counters (tanks?) sooner rather than later?",were there any wars or battles before world war 1 that were potential precursors to how technology would force commanders to adapt as they did in ww1

Long story short, I realize I love History the most and I’ve decided to go through all of American History. Right now I’m on the French and Indian war and I never truly understood how important is was. Firstly, It was a world war. If the French, Canadians, and their Native American allies won the war, the world may have turned out different. I also think it’s ironic how George Washington and the other Founding Fathers fought alongside the British against the French. The sides would totally flip-flop about a decade later.

history,"I am about 2/3 through my first reading of Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry. My current thoughts are... oh my God, how has no one ever told me that this is one of the most amazing reading experiences I willl ever have?

Because I’ve been so immersed in the awesome story and characters,  I haven’t felt my usual draw to Google dozens of historical questions prompted by my reading. But I have been wondering about one thing in particular. Characters are continually setting out to find people in the vast expanse between Texas and Nebraska (and I assume up to Montana, I’m just not there yet). They set out to find a person or group and, with or without experienced trackers, they often succeed. They do it through word of mouth (seems like the main method), tracking skills (often includes spotting campfires), a supposedly limited number of routes to take, and intuition.

 I understand that it’s a fictional story. Not written by a professional historian. I’m not exactly looking for a referendum on historical accuracy. I just want to hear some accurate historical thoughts on the topic...  Was there actually some sense in the 19th century American West of a small community of people who were at least marginally aware of  everybody important  and who could track down whoever they wanted to find?

I’m sort in love with this novel right now. Maybe I should just be asking professional and amateur historians of the 19th American West to give me their takes on the book overall, I think that’s what I really am hungry for.

history,"I plan to set the last part of my Call of Chtullu one shot on Lake Titicaca in Bolivia. I want my game to be somewhat historically and culturally accurate so I'd like to know where i can find a bit more about the culture of Bolivia at that time so I can make some monsters based on local folklore. Right now I'm leaning towards having them be attacked on the lake by bunyip like creatures called ""coco"" but I was wondering if there were more specific lake dwelling nasties in local mythology since Coco is basically just another term for the boogeyman and I'd like to go deeper than just what I read on wikipedia.

In that same vein I'd like to have the history of Bolivia play a role in the game. I plan on setting it in the 1920s and I know that would place it during a rather violent period of the country's history. Right now I plan on having them arrive during Mallea's reign and I want to have the indigenous revolts during those times play a role. Wikipedia doesn't seem to have a lot of information on the revolts so I'd apricate a source where I can find some surface level information about the conflict.

I can't remember if it was French children or Austrian, but I continually hear of interviews of children after a war being eager and excited for the future but in stark contrast to today's children that are dreading of planetary or societal collapse. I am trying to learn more about why there is such a stark psychological difference between the two groups despite similar age ranges and (in my opinion) sharply more negative environmental factors compared to today.  


Is this mental anguish a modern phenomena? Does that bit of historical context I'm looking for even exist?

history,"Robert E. Lee chose treason to protect and expand slavery. I grew up, however, believing that Lee was the greatest man who ever lived. Now, as a retired US Army brigadier general and professor emeritus of history at West Point, I know I was wrong. Every part of my life led me to venerate enslavers and believe the Lost Cause Myth that the Civil War wasn’t fought over slavery and that Lee and his Confederate comrades were honorable gentlemen fighting for a righteous cause. Books, movies, my hometowns (Alexandria, VA and Monroe, GA), my college (Washington and Lee), the army, and West Point where I taught military history for two decades all glorified Confederates and supported white supremacy. Now, after years of study, I know that Confederates refused to accept a democratic election and chose treason and war to perpetuate human enslavement. Nothing honorable about traitors. After the war, white southerners created a series of myths and lies to maintain political power through terror, segregation, and disenfranchisement. Memorials in stone and on paper were part of the foundation for white supremacy. You may know me from a [video](https://www.prageru.com/video/was-the-civil-war-about-slavery/) I did six years ago on the cause of the Civil War (slavery BTW!). People sent death threats to me, an army officer at West Point, about history. Unbelievable. History is dangerous! It forces us to question our personal and national myths and identity and that really upsets some people. Yet, if we want to deal with racism, we must first understand its long history. The only way to prevent a racist future is to first understand our racist history. For more, find my book, [Robert E.

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday february 24 2021

history,"I was looking through books from my childhood and one was called the worst villains from history, when I flicked through it I saw people like Attila the Hun and  Elizabeth Báthory, a Hungarian lady that bathed in children’s blood, So why did the writers feel compelled to include one of Rome’s merciful and enlightened men in this list of historical assholes. I remembered how history teachers at my school generally regarded Caesar as power hungry and an inciter of violence but it was far from the truth as I discovered in later life.

Caesar forgave Gallic tribes that had rebelled, and they rebelled many times every time of which he offered them peaceful surrender and even when his soldiers went on murder sprees it was not him who ordered them like the pillaging of the Arverni. In a civil war his lovers son, Brutus sided against him and fought on the opposite side in battles, yet after Caesar had defeated his enemy he cried with joy at the sight that Brutus was alive and well and instantly forgave him, as well as releasing any captured officer serving in Pompey’s army. Apart from a few dubious activities he does not deserve his place in pop history as a villain for the crime of being stupidly merciful. 

I know that occasionally he was not merciful and could be vindictive but it hardly merits his place in the annals of villains.",why is caesar demonised

history,"  

The school history curriculum sucks!

Every course or class I’ve ever been part of has been either been overly focused on largely insignificant and drab kings and queens of England or is blatantly Eurocentric. So much so, I question how ignorant the people must have been who put it together. 

Furthermore, I understand why the teachers seem to be okay with this or at least begrudgingly accept it as ‘how we must be taught’. I don’t see the argument for why studying events outside of this narrow-minded system would be ‘irrelevant’ or ‘unnecessary’. History didn’t begin in 1066 or 1776, it began with the great civilisations of the Near East, China, India, The Americas and Africa. Would being taught about Bronze Age Collapse, Three Kingdoms, Mughals, Inca, Aztec, Mali, Asante, Majapahit empire and Ottomans provide us with a more open-minded and well-rounded interpretation of history? Yes. Would understanding and empathising with the cultures of people who are so often taken for granted in their contributions to society, be effective in reducing racial prejudice and historical benightedness? Yes.

People are always going to be ignorant of the past, but shouldn’t schools the very harbours of presumed enlightenment be producing students who believe 1066 or 1776 were the most defining moments in human history? Or that Henry VIII and George Washington defined everything about the world today? Certainly not. 

Moreover, people still seem to possess this troglodytic European idea that colonisation was a process that came about purely due to, the inferior nature of their New World counterparts. Blah! I don’t want to take away from European history, but we need to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation we now find ourselves in. I love every nook and cranny of history, however; I won’t stand for Nationalistic agendas overshadowing the subject by projecting false narratives about events and glorifying historical figures who really don’t deserve the praise.

What are people’s thoughts on this? I’d love to hear.

**TLDR: History curriculum bad, Eurocentric and drab, we’d be much better exploring a wider range of topics.**",history in the school curriculum
history,"I want to start a discussion about which is the most important emperor in Japan. For me it was Mutsuhito because with him Japan became a modern country. But I want to know if there's any other emperor that can be considered more important than Mutsuhito due to any reason, so please tell me if you are okay with what the question says or you find that maybe another is the most important.

Also with this question I want to see if I can learn new things about japanese history. I'm interested in learning a lot of japanese history and already read a book, but I need more and I'm not succesful at finding a good source or book, so if you could tell me that would be wonderful.

history,"Asking because I'm curious. The Greeks and Romans had built realistic statues for over 700 years before Constantine. In Rome the statue of Constantine (Emperor 306-337 AD) is one of the largest ever made. His triumphal arch is clearly in the classical tradition, albeit largely recut. The fact his basilica is the largest on the Forum indicates the Emperors weren't short of money. 

Yet 50 years after his death very few classical statues are produced and the quality is much less. Even in the East centuries later, Emperor Justinian, who built a church as large as the Colosseum didn't leave many statues behind.

What drove the change? Religion? Impoverishment of citizens outside of the emperor? Deaths of craftsmen from the plague?

history,"The standard measure of economic inequality today is income inequality, but disaggregated income data has not always been well documented. What sort of measures do historians use to try and gauge historical levels of economic inequality?

For context, suppose I am considering data on towns and cities for the Censuses for the State of New York, 1855 and 1865, which don't contain income data. Nowadays, I could construct measures of economic inequality to match census locations using data from a multitude of rich surveys which document incomes, but I am not aware of any for that period. 

Some initial thoughts are that the 1855 and 1865 censuses contain data on number of type (wood/brick/stone/etc.) of dwelling and average value of type by place (pg. 254), so I could  a crude measure of property inequality for each place. The censuses also include detailed data on distribution of manufacturing wages (pg. 515), but this is aggregated to the county level and only for white men and women (employed in commercial manufacturing).

Does anyone know any sources relevant to this 1855/65 case? More generally, what other sort of sources of data do historians turn to to capture economic inequality in the absence of income data?",competing historical measures of economic inequality in the absence of income data

history,"The London Protocol of 3 February 1830 was an agreement between the three Great Powers (The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, The Kingdom of France and the Russian Empire), which amended the decisions of the 1829 protocol and established Greece as an independent, sovereign state.
As a result of the Greek War of Independence, which had begun in 1821, and the Great Powers' intervention in the conflict in the Battle of Navarino (1827), the creation of some form of Greek state in southern Greece had become certain. In 1827, the Greek Third National Assembly entrusted the governance of the fledgling nation to Ioannis Kapodistrias, who arrived in Greece in January 1828. Alongside his efforts to lay the foundations for a modern state, Kapodistrias undertook negotiations with the Great Powers as to the extent and constitutional status of the new Greek state.
In March 1829, the foreign ministers of the Great Powers signed the first London Protocol, according to which Greece would become an autonomous, tributary state under Ottoman suzerainty, under an elected Christian prince and encompassing the heartlands of the Greek uprising, the Morea (Peloponnese), Continental Greece and the Cyclades. Kapodistrias' diplomatic manoeuvres, aided by the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29, resulted in a revision of the protocol on 3 February 1830. According to it, Greece would be fully independent from the Ottoman Empire, but its borders were reduced to the Aspropotamos–Spercheios line. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (the future King of Belgium) was selected as the first King of Greece, but he rejected the offer.
The protocol was yet again amended in the London Conference of 1832, which established the final borders of the Kingdom of Greece and gave the crown to the Bavarian prince Otto.",today febuary 3rd 1830 greece was recognized again as a sovereign nation in london protocols creating the first peoples hellenic republic
history,"I know that while in the past a lot of these things have been thought of as elements of the same package, archeologists and historians nowadays don’t see them that way. We have examples of monumental architecture and large, intricate settlements built by hunter gatherers (Gobekli Tepe, Jomon civilization), powerful hierarchies that show up without large settlements (burials of closely interrelated individuals all over the northern Neolithic British isles), intensive craft specialization without sedentism (ancient Indo-European steppe people). Clearly there’s no set order in which these things must develop, nor are they guaranteed to stick around once they show up.

But one thing that I haven’t heard about is writing arising on its own without those things surrounding it. Did hunter-gatherers ever develop writing? I know that things like tally marks were common, but what about more complex, abstract systems of symbols?

I guess that writing might be difficult for historians and archeologists to detect as compared to something like monumental architecture. Could it have arisen independently many times in the past, only to be forgotten?",has writing ever been developed in societies that didnt have things like monumental architecture powerful hierarchies domestic plants and animals large settlements etc

history,"I've been thinking about this and I've come to 7 candidates:
1. Italy - because, well I don't think I need much reasoning here, city of Rome is located in this country
2. Turkey - part of the Roman Empire was in the east with its capital being Constantinople and that part of the Empire survived. Ottomans conquered it and the Ottoman Sultan used the title Kayser-i-Rum (Emperor of Romans) so they were the legitimate successor to ""Byzantine"" Empire the successor of Ottoman Empire is Turkey
3. Greece - Greeks were free population of Roman Empire which meant they were Roman, and they actually referred to themselves as Roman until recently (200 years or so) and their culture continued to be Roman
4. Russia - Sophia Palaiologina (niece of last Roman Emperor Constantine XI) married the Russian prince Ivan III who proclaimed himself as Tsar (after Caesar) and all later Russian tsars continued, Moscow was even called the third Rome (Constantinople being the second)
5. France - the Pope crowned Charlemagne as the Emperor of Rome
6. Germany - Holy Roman Empire (which I know wasn't holy, nor Roman and most definitely not an empire) was seen on the West as the successor of Roman Empire and its successor after Napoleon conquered HRE was German Confederation which lead to North German Confederation and then German Empire &gt; Weimar Republic &gt; Third Reich &gt; Germany and to the lesser point, germanic people were those to conquered Rome in the first place which I know doesn't mean Germans but I thought to mention it
7. Austria - if we were to say that HRE was a legitimate successor of Roman Empire then its Emperor would be considered the Roman Emperor and that was a Habsburg who at the same time was Emperor of Austria and later Austria-Hungary which leads to Austria of today

I personally see Italy as the successor when it comes to geographic location, Turkey when it comes who conquered what and Greece when it comes to culture

I know most of these are silly but I was thinking about who could claim to be the Roman Emperor today and then thought wait which country even succeeded Roman Empire so I wanted to share my thoughts and learn",which country is the successor of roman empire

Visiting Moosonee  and Moose Factory, both towns along the Moose River, Snyder finds that these settlements embody the complexities and ironies of a region where the indigenous people have suffered from dispossession and wrenching change but have nevertheless endured with remarkable resilience. Calling the Moose River “wilderness,” Snyder concludes, is not useful: it hides the presence of people who have lived there for thousands of years.",looking for cree country finding mushkegowuk

Justinians indefinite peace that he paid a massive sum for with the Persians for example lasted only a few years. And it happened multiple times with the Persians though I don’t specifically remember the other times. 

The barbarians constantly breaking treaties would make sense because it’s not like they were an organized bunch nor had as much affairs with the world as the Persians but the Persians too always broke treaties with the romans. 

It brought me to question the significance of a treaty even with a civilized state. What are the repercussions of breaking them? There doesn’t seem to be any as the opportunity far outweighs any possible repercussions if any.",what are the real diplomatic repercussions for breaking treaties

Then comes 1812, Jame Madison is ready to take over Canada, yet he is confident thinking that both Lower and Upper Canada would join freely, seeming to forget that now Upper Canada also had people who use to live in the US, but fled as they were still loyal to the crown.  Yet when the news came that Canada didn't want to join, it shocked them.

"" It was immediately realized that the Bible carried an immense importance in the founding of this country, as it was the very place where the Executive Branch of the Government had been created. Furthermore, unlike most other documents associated with the founding of the country, it remains uniquely in private hands.

A sheet was added towards the front of the Bible identifying it was the one used in the Inauguration of President Washington. At the top it bears an engraving of George Washington himself. It faces a page bearing the image of King George II, which, as the copyright owner, was contained in every King James Bible printed.

It was decided not to remove the page at the time since that would have amounted to desecration of a Bible.  Instead, the image of George Washington is placed higher than that of the King!

The inscription below the image of Washington reads: 

“On this sacred volume, on the 30th day of April, A.L. 5789, in the City of New York, was administered to George Washington, the first president of the United States of America, the oath to support the Constitution of the United States. This important ceremony was performed by the Most Worshipful Grand Master of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York, the Honorable Robert R. Livingston, Chancellor of the State.

*Fame stretched her wings and with her trumpet blew.Great Washington in near. What praise is due?What title shall he have? She paused, and said:Not one – his name alone strikes every title dead.”*

Almost immediately it featured in key ceremonies, and was carefully preserved by the Lodge. At the present time only Master Masons at their Degree Ceremony, the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Master of New York, the Mayor of New York City, the Governor of the State of New York, and the President of the United States may take an Oath or Obligation upon this Bible. And only the President may do so with bare hands.""

Interestingly against American Patriots,  British always had numerical superiority and had better training. Yet they lost. Where as in India starting from Battle of Pallasay to Munger, they were down by 1:30, 1:10, and yet they managed to win. I always wondered why. My conclusion -

1. American Patriots were fighting to set up a democracy and freedom-every soldier gave their best where as soldiers of Nawabs and Kings in India were salaried and for them it was just a change of master 
2.  Also in India , military was managed by East India company where as in US, it was Royal army.  East India company was very efficient since they were corporate-mainly they will promote leaders like Robert Clive who  otherwise won't stand much chance in British Aristocracy.

history,"First I am not a huge astronomy nor cartographic person. I know basic (probably more than the average person) about maps, but I'm writing this in laymen's (for my sake as well as for other readers' like myself).

So I wasn't really doing research on maps, but I was re-reading a book on a pre-modern civilization's astrology, and I was surprised (I didn't catch it the first time I read this book years ago), that the ancients didn't particularly orient towards the north.

I guess because of our/mymodern understanding of geographic orientation, I assumed that it was ""natural"" for ancient folks to orient towards a North/South axis. I realized that without a compass and depending where you are eg 'the equator', Polaris/N. Star isn't that helpful (S. Cross might be, not exactly sure if it is all year round)...

Many constellations ""move"" around throughout the year (not counting the fact that constellations and stars ""move"" permanently in even over longer periods of time + magnetic poles switch at even longer cycles)---makes it great for tracking cyclical time (ie year) for but in terms of orientation it's not really that helpful all year round.

What's more ""constant"" is the rising and setting of the sun (ie east and west). In this particular region, they used that axis  + the seasonal winds (the 'moon' or moonson axis) as their ""cardinal directions"" in place of north/south (as well geographic orientations of leeward/windward ie ortographic as well as seaward/inland). 

I guess my question is what type of directional orientation did ancient (pre-classical, classical and early-modern) civilizations used? 

How did they view this concept and how did it evolve over time? 

I know the ancient Egyptians used the North Star quiet a lot but medieval Arabs used to orient maps with the east on top (where north would be today) I've seen this also in some maps from Iberia from early to late Age of Discovery...was this the 'norm' in ancient Near East and Europe?

history,[removed],what factors contributed to kaiser wilhelm ii to be abdicated
history,"I've been in this subreddit for a few days, got here after searching for ancient Greece, and stumbled upon a post about the golden age of Islam, and it seemed like my fellow Persians were having fun writing their thoughts with little to no consideration about facts.

Their narrative was about how the golden age was mainly Persian and Arabs had little to contribute to it.

So let me start from the beginning.

After the Umayyad dynasty collapsed the Abbasids toke over the Caliphate in the year of 750, they were from the Arabic tribe of [Quraysh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quraysh_tribe) (pay attention to the importance of tribes because they play a big factor in distinguishing Arabs from Persians) and they descended from Mecca - in modern day Saudi Arabia.

The Abbasids built the great city of Baghdad in the year of 762, which served as the intellectual center of the world, as well as the place where the [house of wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom) will be built during the reign of Harun al-Rashid.

Many books were transmitted from various languages to Arabic including the Greek classics.

During the reign of [Al-Ma'mun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ma%27mun) the golden age was at its peak, he was heavily invested into science that he send an expedition just to measure the earth's circumference because he wasn't satisfied with the answers that he read, and the measured circumference turned out to be very close to the real one that we know today.

Having Baghdad as the center of the world and the house of wisdom as the greatest university for students to learn, it is was only natural for people from different ethnicity including Persians to travel there to learn at the house of wisdom.

Scientists from Arabic and Persian origin were most notable among all different ethnicity, among them were the father of chemistry [Jabir ibn Hayyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabir_ibn_Hayyan) who was an Arab from the tribe of [Azd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azd), even though many Persians were to claim him to be of their own since they don't mention his tribe in the context.

But that doesn't mean there were no notable scientists of Persian origin, [al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi) was one of the brightest mind to ever walk on earth, and he was Persian.

You can simply look at the last name of scholars in the golden age to know whether they are from an Arabic origin or Persians.

Ibn al-Nafis, al-Idrisi, Al-Zahrawi, and Al-Kindi were all Arabs descended from what is known today as Saudi Arabia.

Avicenna, Omar Khayyam, al-Razi, and al-Khwarizmi were all Persians descended from what is known today as Iran.

The collective works of Persians and Arabs formed the golden age, but don't forget that almost all the Persian scholars flourished in the golden age when the Caliphate was ruled by Arabs.

You can look for Persian scholars before when Arabs built Baghdad and you will be shocked about the number and the quality of work they have done compared to what they achieved after the building of Baghdad and when it was ruled by Arabs.

After the fall of the Abbasids came the Ottomans, and the first thing they did was banning the printing of books which was a major blow to science and literature in the region.

The Ottoman empire witnessed no golden age of science, yet people don't give credit to their Arab predecessor and what they achieved.

history,"As above I think the situation following the death of commudus almost mirrors Neros death.Neros started the year of the 4 Emperors.Commudus’s death started the year of the 5. The chaos following Neros death was ended with the Flavian dynasty and the strong effective leadership of Vespasian who stabilised the Empire and promoted further expansion. The chaos following the death of Commodus was ended by the ascension of the Severan dynasty and the strong effective leadership of Severus who stabilised the empire and promoted expansion

Surely the “beginning of the end” should be seen as the end of the severan dynasty / death of Caracalla.",why is the reign of commodus judged as the beginning of the end of the empire

history,"Henry VI had a flimsy claim to the throne and was never secure when he had it. Given this, someone like Arthur Plantagenet who was the son of a king or Charles Somerset, who descended from the same line of Henry, just in the male line, might seem threatening to him.

history,"So I am interested in point of view thinking of military commanders. 

What is the focus of a company, a battalion or a division commander or field marshall? What do they think about if he is planning? My general understanding is that the higher the hierarchical level the more abstract and organisational in nature a thinking becomes but thats about it. 

I am reading ""A Genius for War"" which is the history of the german general staff and while I like the book its a bit light on military concepts.  And if military maneuvers are described by how genius the tactics etc were its of course always a backlook. But planning in the situation itself is of course much more precarious, you never know if a plan will work and worries you maybe had before a plan was implemented don't matter afterwards and are often forgotten. So does anybody have some suggestions where to look for this kind of stuff? I am mostly interested in WW2 and maybe Napoleonic Era but I am also open for other sources. I am also planning to read stuff like Clausewitz but again I doubt it will scratch the itch I have. Maybe I am looking for some biographies? But even then those are written with a looking back view. Well anyway, please let me know if you have some recommendations. Thanks!",military thinking necessary for each formation level point of view kinda thing

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday january 20 2021

history,"Obviously, the Union could not have perfectly foreseen the economic cost of the civil war and abolition, but did anyone ever propose compensating slaveowners for the immediate freedom of its slaves? The war cost the Union 68 billion and there were approximately 3 million slaves in 1860.

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday january 13 2021

I thought that given how fast the Italian army dismembered after the Armistice most of the lower ranks were actually unhappy, but I was curious about how well-received the call to war was by the common folk outside big cities.

Did their compliance with Mussolini steam from actual respect or were they just fearful because of the usual fascist techniques of oppression?",what was the common italian peoples opinion on joining ww2 on the side of the germans

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday january 06 2021

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday december 30 2020

history,"For some time now, the mod team has had an informal moratorium on posts involving memorabilia, family history, and genealogy. While these things are usually historical in nature and of considerable interest to our community, experience has shown that as soon as we approve one good one, we are immediately flooded with a wave of similar submissions, usually of progressively lower quality. 

This is particularly true of ""war trophies"". If you had a grandparent or great-grandparent who fought in one of the World Wars (ie most of us), odds are high they brought back some bit of equipment or another, usually a helmet or a firearm. If we approve your super-rare ivory-handled and gold-inlaid bazooka signed by Hitler himself, we have to approve 25 other posts about used jump boots and faded flags and letters to grandma. So the result is that the sheer volume begins to change the character of the subreddit from a place to discuss *history* to a place to discuss *historical stuff*. That's not our mission. 

Our mission also isn't such posts as:

* helping to translate that super interesting old deed you found in the basement while renovating
* telling you who Doña María de las Mercedes García-Carrión Martínez y Carlos María Eduardo García de la Cal Fernández Leal Luna Delgado Galván Sanz was, because you stumbled across them while looking up your 7th-great grandparents second cousins twice removed and it's a funny name
* wanting to know more about the Rough Riders, because great-great grandma was married to one

Those things do indeed interact with history, but the conversations they result in are usually not historical in nature. Experience has shown us that they tend to result in a high amount of off-topic commentary. 

With that in mind, we have introduced a new Rule 13: 

&gt; **Rule 13: No Memorabilia, Family History, or Genealogy.**

&gt; While that Stahlhelm that grandpa brought back from the War is in fact historical, experience has shown that posts about such items results in conversation more often focused on things like perceived coolness or identification than on any history it may represent. Ditto for great-grandma's sewing machine, or old pictures of the family farm, or what have you. Therefore, we generally do not allow such submissions because they result in off-topic conversations. Please consider more topical subreddits like /r/whatisthisthing, /r/OldSchoolCool, or /r/Genealogy instead.

&gt; However, with that being said, we also acknowledge that there can be rare exceptions. If you think have a truly historical item to submit, please contact the mods beforehand.

And the prior Rule 13 - This is an actively moderated subreddit and calls will be made at the moderator's discretion - has become Rule 14. 

We are also considering having one dedicated day per week or month where such submissions are both allowed and encouraged, much as we do with Silly Questions and Book lists. 

This thread is both to notify you and to provide a space for discussion. Love it? Let us know! Hate it? Likewise. We are particularly looking for suggestions as to what day might work best as a dedicated day for the submissions. Thanks!",rules update formalizing the informal ban on posts involving memorabilia family history and genealogy

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday december 23 2020

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday december 16 2020

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday december 09 2020

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday december 02 2020

history,"Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday november 25 2020

history,"In WW1 The British Empire fought on several fronts in several theatres either holding the Line or going forward everywhere they fought by the end of the war.By 1918 Britain had almost single handedly collapsed the Ottoman empire through offensives.Mainly the British and French had begun  to steadily push back Germany along the western front, Britain had crippled the German navy and annihilated the central powers in Africa and Asia. I think its fair to say that Britain played an effective and major part on the western front while eventually dominating mostly singlehandedly the other theatres of the war It was involved in.

However come ww2 Britain struggled to survive being completely pushed out of Europe, and later struggling to launch any meaningful invasion attack on the Nazi empire despite the Nazis being preoccupied in Russia.Similarly in Asia things were going equally poorly with even British Burma being invaded by Japan.Britain had gone from perhaps the strongest world power in ww1 loosing the fight in multiple theatres to inferior to Germany the Ussr the Usa and maybe Japan in the interwar period.Only a small fraction of the army was lost with the fall of France That cannot be the reason for Britains failure to reinvade the continent after Barbarossa.

Only Ireland left the empire in the interwar period.I cant understand why the Empires ability to prosecute a global war so drastically reduced in this period.

I also know that this new system of international trade had a large impact on China. New types of crops like maize and potatoes led to a large population boom and an influx of silver from mines in the Spanish Colonies led to a boost in the Chinese economy.

But how was South Asia affected by all this? I know that the Indian Subcontinent was a large player in the International Trading system and before colonization a lot of South Asians made a fortune in selling spices, sugarcane, textiles, and other valuable goods. But what were they able to get in return from the Colombian Exchange and how did it affect South Asia? The only information I was able to find on how they were affected by the Exchange was the importation of new crops like maize and chili which impacted their cuisine and they were also exposed to diseases like Syphilis's.

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

&amp;#x200B;

When the Russians became fond of the ideals of Karl Marx after the Russian Revolution because of the treatment that they received from the oligarchy of the Tsar, they became incredibly passionate about Communism, especially Lenin who, from my knowledge, was so passionate about developing a Communist nation possibly out of spite against the Tsar that he wanted to create any kind of propoganda that glorifies the promised ideals of Communism and shun those who were against them (which sort of the opposite of what Marx proposed about the concept of equality).

&amp;#x200B;

Until WW2 came around, there was already a terror against Communism and was deemed as a threat by many parts of the world. Events like the Shanghai Massacre occurred where plenty of people who were affiliated with Communism or the Communist party were executed, while on the other side, there was the Red Terror where anyone who anti-Bolshevik were oppressed and even executed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then Stalin came along who industrialised Russia but also put it in a very poor state, even periods of famine occurred and he killed multiple people, sometimes even at random for anyone who was deemed to be anti-Communist - people like doctors, lawyers and so on (which was very ironic because not only put the USSR into a very poor state economically, but when Stalin was in poor health condition, there were no doctors to treat him).

To my knowledge, when Stalin came into power, he wanted his name to be a name that instills fear in anyone in the USSR. And to my knowledge, many of those who worked with Stalin were either both afraid of him, or were as corrupt as he was.

When the Cold War happened where it started about who owns what after WW2 and neither the allies wanted to give up their side of Germany, and neither did the USSR and the Cold War was like a lengthy argument over philosophies and ideals that led into a war that everyone was eager to fight but not willing to go the extra mile with nukes because that would have meant that the first target would be them.

So both sides wanted to find ways to demonise the other and find ways to gain allies or to make themselves look like the heroes of the story like America wanted to change its ideology towards a more Christian focus (which is how ""in God, we trust"" came into being) and the USSR did the opposite, America had the Red Scare and these banana republics and also the CIA gave weapons to dictators to stop the spread of Communism.

While on the other side, the USSR had the Warsaw pact and wanted to get allies to be affiliated with Communism, namely countries in Latin America and China.

&amp;#x200B;

Now many people were aware of the discrepancies between what Marx proposed and how Communism was executed and many people started to realise the difference between the results of capitalistic ideals, and that of communism such as lower economic growth, less variety in wages, less variety in consumer products and so on.

Yet many people, including those who became affiliated with Communism like Che Guevara and China continued to want to spread their own ideal versions of Communism (and Che Guevara became an icon of revolution and rebellion while Mao became a symbol of oppression and corruption).

For 40 years, these two ""empires"" of sorts were on edge against each other and both were finding ways to outmatch each other, sometimes through other means like the space race.

&amp;#x200B;

But what I find a bit confusing is that, why did the people of the USSR continue to push this agenda of communism when the history of communism showed that it was very ugly and violent and the results of communism were not as prosperous as claimed by Marx or as compared to capitalism at the time? What made them so passionate about communism despite that the results of communism were not as prosperous?

&amp;#x200B;

How come people were already so afraid of communism since the time of the Russian Revolution even before people like Stalin came along?",the cold war and also the fear against the spread of communism have lasted for over 40 years but what were the reasons that this pattern of fear passion and conflict have persevered for so long before it died out during the fall of the ussr

On March 5, 1946, Prime Minister, Winston Churchill said the following:

&gt;From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an “Iron Curtain” has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.

However, there were flaws in this speech. Stettin is east of Berlin. How could Berlin be behind the curtain if it is west of Stettin?

I would assume that:

* Stettin was an allied held panhandle which stretched across the East Germany's coast
* The allies controlled East Germany and the Soviets had a panhandle stretching from Poland to Berlin

But it isn't.

A more accurate speech for Churchill would be:

&gt;From Lubeck in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an “Iron Curtain” has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.",churchills iron curtain speech was geographically wrong

history,"I read the book ""The Soul of Battle"" written by Victor Davis Hanson. In it he describes the deeds of General Patton.  My question is about this passage in the book:

"" Patton, while elated at his finest hour of service in Europe, felt that once more his magnificent army had been denied a great opportunity - since arriving in Normandy, the *fourth* such occasion that he felt might have shortened the war considerably had he been given his freedom.""  (Victor Davis Hanson, The Soul of battle, Anchor Books, New York, page 311)

The fourth occasion the writer is referring to is the wish of General Patton to cut off the German troops on the West side of the Rhine by going into the rear of the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge.

I can mention two other instances when General Patton was ordered to halt. 

In Normandy he was ordered to stand down with his troops and not close the pocket of Falaise. The second time when he was ordered not to advance and wasn't given petrol when closing in on the Rhine river. Priority was given to Montgomery.

But what was the other time he was ordered to halt? Probably it is somewhere in the book, but I couldn't find it.",question on general patton

The British Isles has such a long history but despite being from there I only know the most recent parts of it, I'd like to learn more about this place.",im playing assassins creed valhalla and its got me interested in medieval england

history,"The sinking of RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912 is one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. Mainstream retellings of the tragedy often overlook that the “unsinkable” Titanic was not alone when it sank. A mystery ship was spotted within view of the sinking ship, but instead of sailing closer to aid the drowning passengers, the mystery ship seemingly ignored a fusillade of rockets and signals and sailed away. 

American and British inquiries accused the SS Californian and its captain, Stanley Lord, of abandoning the Titanic. Decades later, the discovery of Titanic’s wreck exonerated Lord and the Californian’s role in the disaster, re-opening accounts that implicate another ship.

In [Secrets of the Dead: Abandoning the Titanic](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/abandoning-titanic-promo/5432/), join a team of investigators as they search for the identity of the mystery ship that turned away from the Titanic in its darkest hour, abandoning thousands of lives to the icy waters and their untimely demise.

history,"I'm reading a few biographies of a famous person, let's let this figure be anonymous for now, and it seems the majority of sources state this person moved from Louisiana to Illinois in 1928 although this person appears on the 1930 census, at 18 years old, in Louisiana. There's a facsimile of the census record, so I'm as sure as I can be that it's accurate.

One source is an autobiography. Another is an extremely detailed biography. There are two other supporting biographies of an associate that support this figure being in Illinois in 1928. Assuming these are accurate, what would explain why this person appears on a census many states away? Did the census worker need to see this person to count them? If this head of household lied to the census worker, was there any benefit to this like lower taxes, or the equivalent of not reporting someone's death so a family member can continue to receive their Social Security checks?

Edit: writing was unclear",what benefit might there have been in lying on the us census

history,"    I'm reading this book at the moment and was wondering how accurate this book is.  Mainly about how casual the Samurai regarded seppuku.  Every little mistake they seem to ask 'May I have permission to commit Seppuku?'  I Know that it was not a super uncommon practice but I always assumed it was only for very dire situations such as killing an important person in a fit of rage or something truly terrible.  That or maybe loosing a battle.  But would the heads of households or clans really just tell people to kill themselves for showing up late or something like messing up their uniform etc, something ridiculous like this? 
Was the thought of reincarnation and Karma really that overpowering that people's lives were worth that little?

    Also if there's anything else that anyone who is familiar with this period of Japanese culture that is noticed about this book, correct of incorrect please let me know.  I really want this book to be all correct because he is building a beautiful although brutal world but I cant imagine this big of a book being error free.

history,"The 17th century was a very interesting period for England. In this century, all the kings fascinate me but nobody more than King Charles and king James. Both considered to be bad and sloppy kings today. 

Charles was struck dead by execution and had major enemies among his parliamentarians. Whereas James, who likewise dabbled in Catholicism, aroused the anger of his countrymen to invite William of Orange to invade England. 

In the end, both lost. One failed a civil war, went to trial and was decapitated while the other was forced into exile in France. 

It’s a curious thing that these two men had similar problems governing their country despite the immense contributions they made to them. 

James never had to deal with a threatening gang of parliamentarians like his father but also, it could be argued, Charles could have left England, seek shelter with Louis XIII or Philip of Spain and then raise an army to take England back. 

James was quite incompetent in his war with William, I think at that point he didn’t really even care anymore.",would you consider king james worse than his father king charles

Why is history often taught, even in college, through a satellites eye view and ever so polished? Why is it so difficult to get a sense of what individuals are feeling, outside of witnesses and first hand accounts, when trying to read and understand history? Are we too removed as a society, have these most intense moments and emotions been lost throughout time? I think now being about 4 generations removed from the “silent generation” has left us forgetful of the ever so important events that had to happen to get to where we are today.",july 1944 bonzai cliff saipan island in the northern marian islands

history," Hi everybody,

I’m Lawrence Sondhaus, author of *World War One: The Global Revolution* 2nd edition. ([https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/world-war-one/13C0FEFC94C3BDFF0B114A4697A02995](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/world-war-one/13C0FEFC94C3BDFF0B114A4697A02995)) I teach modern European History at the University of Indianapolis and I have written several books on naval and military strategy and policy.

Ask me anything! I’m particularly interested in key figures and their strategic decisions, then operations, tactics, and logistics. I’m not too keen on discussing weaponry. I’ll engage hypotheticals, within reason.

*World War One: The Global Revolution* explores both the revolutionary advances that defined the war, such as the technological advances that made the war so deadly, and the revolutionary pressures that grew out of the war that led to the collapse of the Romanov, Habsburg, and Ottoman Empires. In the new edition I cover the political, economic, social and cultural history of the war at home and on the frontlines, enlivening the narrative with personal accounts, guides to key controversies, and numerous maps and photographs.",ask me anything -- lawrence sondhaus -- author of world war one the global revolution

history,"[About two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/jaxoth/do_your_own_homework/) we also posted this reminder but after wading through our pumpkin spice scented  moderation queue it is clear that many of you haven't gotten the message. 


If you need help with your studies, please visit /r/HomeworkHelp. They won't do it for you, but they can point you in the right direction.

When we've made these reminders in the past, several people have asked for clarification or stated they don't understand why we have such a policy. In general, it comes down to two main reasons:
 
###  Homework help doesn't generate a lot of discussion. They're usually very specific questions that are really only asked as part of homework. 


If in serious numbers (and around this time of year, we're looking at dozens a day) they tend to make the subreddit less attractive for the community in general. Some people might still wonder ""but what is the harm? People can just not respond"". Which is partially correct, we have one factor that makes it a bit more difficult here. 

***Scale***. 

We have roughly 2-3 million unique visitors per month in this subreddit. The sort of homework questions we are talking about are the ""drive-by"" kind of questions. Often very simple, not very engaging or interesting for the rest of the community. If allowed though they tend to flood the subreddit which will drown out other, better, threads.


### Part of doing homework/research is applying and practicing the skills required for understanding and working with history. 

Asking people directly in /r/history defeats that very purpose. In many cases it is plagiarism, which is a serious academic offence, and anti-cheating software *does* scan reddit for similarities.

In those cases /r/HomeworkHelp is simply the better subreddit, as it focuses on the process of doing it properly. 

##### We have less of an issue if someone has done all/some of the below *before* they try to get strangers on the internet to do their work for them:

* Speak to your teacher/lecturer/professor. Attend their office hours or send them an email.
* The recommended reading list for your course should point you in the right direction.
* Check out the book lists [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist) or over on [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books). 
* Google.

We can apply discretion for people who have already done their research, list what they have found and how they have found it and then, for example, asks if there are more places or ways they can find additional information. But simply copying out the essay question verbatim, rewording an essay prompt, or adding ""This is due tomorrow pls help"" will just get removed.

Thanks everyone! And good luck with your studies!",no we really are not going to do your homework

history,"The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday october 28 2020

history,"The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday october 21 2020

history,"As October comes to a close, we have some appropriate AMAs to accompany your horror movie binges.

First, Thomas Moynihan will answer questions on the history of humanity considering its own end and has written a book on the subject, [X-Risk](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/x-risk). Ideas of transhuman replacement and environmental catastrophes existed well before the modern age and this is your chance to ask questions about how people in the past faced the idea of the end of everything human.

Then, for Halloween, Samuel P. Gillis Hogan of the [Arcane: The History of Magic](https://arcanehistory.podbean.com/e/episode-0-welcometo-arcane/) Podcast will be here to answer your questions about human attempts to affect their world through supernatural means. Magician-priests, Necromancers, Astrologers have all had influences from the Etruscan soothsayer who tried to warn Caesar to Elizabeth I’s personal court astronomer, John Dee. You can already listen to episodes on Medieval Ritual Magic and Astrology.

And our Calendar for November is already filling up!

history,"The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday october 14 2020

history,"It's that time of year again, the air is crisp, the days are shorter, and everything middle class white people buy smells like pumpkin spice. 

So, naturally, our moderation queue is full of students (and one PhD candidate!) asking for people to do their homework for them.

This is your semester reminder that /r/history is a place for discussions about history, not begging people to do your homework for you. 

We normally try to filter question posts that just ask questions without providing any other content and we absolutely try to keep our user base from being exploited by anyone trying to use them to crowdsource a research effort. Homework is all of that and a bag of stale chips. 

All homework questions will be put into the circular file. 

If you want help, or want to help someone, with homework please make your way over to /r/HomeworkHelp 

Thanks Everyone. . .expect that PhD candidate, I mean, really?",do your own homework

history,"The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday october 07 2020

history,"The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)",bookclub wednesday september 30 2020
